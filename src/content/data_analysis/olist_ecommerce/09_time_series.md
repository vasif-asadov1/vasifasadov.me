## MoM and Seasonality Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">29. What is the Month-over-Month (MoM) growth rate for total revenue across the entire dataset? Can we identify specific months where the business experienced 'Hyper-Growth' (\>20% increase) versus months of stagnation or contraction? </font>

**Solution:**

- To calculate the month-over-month growth rate, the core metrics must first be aggregated by month. This should be done in the first CTE by joining the orders, payments, and calendar tables. The total number of orders and the total revenue must be calculated for each specific year and month. Canceled or unavailable orders must also be filtered out to ensure the revenue figures are perfectly accurate.

- Next, the historical data must be retrieved to allow for comparison. The lag window function should be used here to fetch the revenue and order volume from both the previous month and the previous year. The data must be ordered chronologically by year and month number to ensure the lag function pulls the correct prior periods for every single row.

- Once the current and previous metrics are aligned, the actual percentage growth must be calculated. The mathematical formula for percentage change will be applied to both month-over-month and year-over-year revenue. A nullif function must be included during the division step to prevent any mathematical errors just in case the previous month had zero recorded revenue.

- Finally, the calculated growth rates must be categorized to clearly highlight business performance. A case statement will be used in the main query to assign a growth performance tag, easily identifying periods of hyper-growth above twenty percent, standard positive growth, or stagnation. An additional case statement should also be applied to flag key seasonal periods like Black Friday and the holiday season to provide necessary business context for any major revenue fluctuations.

**Insights:**


* **The 2017 Startup Boom:** The first half of 2017 is defined by aggressive "Hyper-Growth." Months like February (+107%), March (+50%), and May (+43%) show huge revenue jumps, proving this was the phase where Olist rapidly acquired its early market share.
* **The Black Friday Rollercoaster:** November 2017 was an absolute game-changer. Revenue spiked by 53.3% due to Black Friday sales. However, this created a predictable hangover in December, resulting in a 26.5% contraction as the holiday shopping rush ended.
* **The 2018 Plateau:** After recovering with a strong January 2018 (+27.9%), the platform's growth essentially flattened out. The rest of 2018 is filled with slight contractions (like -11% in February and -10% in June) and very mild growth (like +0.3% in April). The business stopped doubling its size and stabilized at around $1M to $1.15M per month.
* **Ignoring the Noise:** As analysts, we need to ignore the massive percentages at the very start (late 2016) and very end (Sept 2018) of the table. These months only have 1 recorded order, meaning they represent the setup phase and the cutoff date of our dataset, not actual business performance.


## Seasonality Effect


<font color = "#9dc9cf"> 30. How does the revenue of specific months compare across different years (e.g., Jan 2017 vs. Jan 2018)? Can we observe a consistent 'Seasonality Effect' where certain months (like November) consistently outperform others regardless of the year? </font>

**Solution:**

- To analyze the seasonality effect, revenue must first be aggregated by year and month. This should be done in the first CTE by joining the orders, payments, and calendar tables. The total revenue for each month of every year must be calculated while filtering out canceled or unavailable orders to ensure accuracy.

- Next, the lag window function should be used to compare the revenue of the same month across different years. This will allow for a direct year-over-year comparison for each month, such as January 2017 vs January 2018. Additionally, the average monthly revenue for each year should be calculated to serve as a benchmark for identifying seasonal trends.

- Once the current month revenue, previous year same month revenue, and yearly average are all aligned, a seasonality index can be calculated. This index will be derived by dividing the current month's revenue by the yearly average. An index greater than 1.0 will indicate that the month outperformed the year's average, suggesting a strong seasonal effect.

- Finally, the seasonality index should be categorized to clearly identify which months are peak performers, standard performers, or low season periods. A case statement will be used to classify months with a seasonality index above 1.2 as 'Peak Months', those between 0.9 and 1.2 as 'Standard Performance', and those below 0.9 as 'Low Season / Slack Period'. This final output will help determine if certain months consistently outperform others across different years, confirming the presence of a seasonality effect.

**Insights:**


* **Massive Scaling:** Comparing the same months across years shows the true scale of growth. January 2018 revenue was 704% higher than January 2017. Every month in 2018 outperformed the previous year by a huge margin.
* **November is the Undisputed King:** With a Seasonality Index of 1.98, November performs nearly twice as well as the average month. This confirms that Black Friday is the single most important event for the platform's annual revenue.
* **Shift to Year-Round Demand:** In 2017, the first half of the year was considered "Low Season." By 2018, months like March and April became "Peak Months," showing that Olist successfully transitioned into a year-round shopping destination.
* **Predictable Maturity:** The Seasonality Index for 2018 stayed very stable (between 1.03 and 1.21). This indicates that the business became much more predictable as it matured, with less chaotic fluctuations than the previous year.
* **The High-Revenue Window:** A clear "Peak" cluster exists from September to January. This five-month window is the most critical period for the business, likely combining Black Friday, Christmas, and New Year sales.



## Distribution of Order Volume by Day and Hour


<font color = "#9dc9cf"> 31. What is the distribution of order volume across different **Days of the Week** and **Hours of the Day**? Specifically, do we see a 'Lunchtime Spike' (12 PM - 2 PM) or an 'Evening Spike' (8 PM - 10 PM)? </font>

**Solution:**

- To analyze the distribution of order volume across different days of the week and hours of the day, the order data must first be aggregated by extracting the day of the week and hour from the order purchase timestamp. This should be done in a CTE by using date functions to derive these time components. The total number of orders for each combination of day and hour must be calculated while filtering out canceled or unavailable orders.

- Then we can analyze the aggregated data to identify specific patterns. A case statement should be used to classify hours between 12 PM and 2 PM as 'Lunchtime Spike Window' and hours between 8 PM and 10 PM as 'Evening Spike Window'. All other hours can be classified as 'Standard Time'.

- Finally, the results should be ordered by the day of the week and hour to clearly visualize the distribution of order volume throughout the week and identify any consistent spikes during lunchtime or evening hours. This analysis will help determine if there are specific times when customer engagement is higher, which can inform marketing strategies and operational planning.

**Insights:**


* **Monday is the Main Event:** Monday is the busiest day of the week for Olist. It hits peak volumes at 2:00 PM and 9:00 PM. Overall, sales are significantly higher during the workweek (Monday–Friday) than on weekends, showing that customers prefer shopping during work hours or their commute.
* **The Lunchtime Surge:** There is a very consistent "Lunchtime Spike" every single weekday. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, order counts surge as people shop on their breaks. On Tuesdays, for example, volume jumps from 853 at 9:00 AM to a peak of 1,106 by 2:00 PM.
* **The Evening Peak:** Regardless of the day, the highest activity happens during the "Evening Spike" between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Monday at 9:00 PM is the busiest single hour of the entire week with 1,103 orders.
* **Weekend Drop-off:** Shopping activity cools down on Saturdays and Sundays. While the evening spike still exists on Sunday (956 orders at 8:00 PM), the overall baseline is much lower. Saturday is the quietest day on the platform across almost every hour.
* **Late-Night Dormancy:** Across all days, shopping almost completely stops between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM, with most hours dropping below 40 orders. This is the ideal window for system maintenance since traffic is at its lowest.




## Cumulative Revenue and Growth Trajectory


<font color = "#9dc9cf"> 32. What is the cumulative revenue generated over time since the inception of the platform? By plotting the running total of sales, can we visually confirm the business's transition from 'Linear Growth' to 'Exponential Growth' (The Hockey Stick Curve)? </font>


**Solution:**

- To track cumulative revenue and observe the hockey stick growth curve, the total revenue must first be aggregated by year and month. This should be done in the first CTE by joining the orders, payments, and calendar tables, ensuring that canceled or unavailable orders are strictly filtered out.

- Next, a running total of the monthly revenue must be calculated. Window functions should be applied here to continuously sum the monthly revenue over time, ordered chronologically by year and month. This cumulative revenue metric will clearly show the overall growth trajectory of the business from its inception. In the exact same step, historical year-over-year comparisons and yearly averages will also be established to maintain the baseline seasonality analysis.

- To find the peak customer engagement windows, the order distribution by day of the week and hour of the day must be analyzed. A separate CTE should be created to extract the specific day name and hour from the order purchase timestamps. The total number of orders must then be counted for each specific hour of every day to find intraday shopping patterns.

- Finally, these distinct sets of insights must be combined into a single final output. The monthly seasonality and cumulative growth metrics should be selected first. Then, a union all statement must be used to append the day and hour distribution below the monthly data. A case statement will be applied here to tag specific times as lunchtime or evening spike windows. This unified approach will allow the business to view both high-level exponential growth and granular daily shopping habits in one comprehensive report.

/* growth and seasonality analysis
    objective: 
        1. compare specific months across years (e.g., Jan 2017 vs Jan 2018).
        2. calculate a 'seasonality index' to identify recurring monthly trends.
        3. analyze order distribution by Day of the Week and Hour of Day.
        4. calculate cumulative revenue to track "The Hockey Stick" growth curve.
    logic: 
      - aggregate revenue by year and month for high-level trends.
      - use window functions for year-over-year and running total calculations.
      - extract time-of-day and day-of-week metrics to find peak engagement windows.

**Insights:**

* **Hockey Stick Growth Confirmed:** The cumulative revenue curve shows a classic "hockey stick" shape. The platform started extremely slowly in 2016, but the slope turned sharply upward in mid-2017. It took 7 months to reach the first $1M in total sales, but by 2018, the business was hitting that same $1M milestone every single month.
* **Rapid Scaling Milestones:** The business reached a $5M cumulative revenue mark in October 2017. Incredibly, it only took another 5 months to double that total to $10M by March 2018. This acceleration proves that Olist successfully transitioned from a struggling startup phase into a high-growth scale-up.
* **The November 2017 Catalyst:** November 2017 wasn't just a good month; it was a permanent game-changer. The massive revenue spike during that period permanently steepened the cumulative growth line. After this point, the business never returned to its lower 2017 baselines, maintaining a much higher trajectory throughout 2018.
* **Final Revenue Snapshot:** By the end of the recorded data in August 2018, the platform had generated over $15.7M in total revenue. The trajectory remained strong and steep right until the data cutoff, suggesting that the business was still in a healthy expansion phase.


## Conclusion


**What We Did:**
* Analyzed **Month-over-Month (MoM)** revenue growth to pinpoint hyper-growth phases versus periods of stabilization.
* Calculated a **Seasonality Index** to determine the baseline importance of each month in the yearly cycle.
* Performed a **Year-over-Year (YoY)** comparison to measure the scale of expansion between 2017 and 2018.
* Conducted an **Intra-day Analysis** of order volumes by hour and day to identify peak shopping windows.
* Tracked **Cumulative Revenue** to visualize the business’s overall growth trajectory.

**What We Obtained (Key Findings):**
* **The "Hockey Stick" Effect:** Olist successfully moved from a slow startup phase in 2016 to a high-speed scale-up in 2017. The cumulative revenue trajectory turned sharply exponential in late 2017, reaching a total of over $15.7M by the end of the study period.
* **Maturity & Stability:** While 2017 was a year of chaotic growth, 2018 showed a mature plateau. Revenue stabilized at a predictable baseline of ~$1M per month, indicating that the platform successfully retained its market share.
* **November is the Revenue Engine:** November is the undisputed peak of the year. With a seasonality index of 1.98, it brings in nearly double the revenue of an average month, confirming that Black Friday is the most critical event for Olist’s financial health.
* **The Weekday Workflow:** Shopping is a "workweek" activity. Monday is the highest-volume day, and sales consistently dip during the weekends. 
* **Dual-Spike Daily Behavior:** Customers follow a predictable daily routine across all states, with a primary **Lunchtime Spike (12 PM - 2 PM)** and a secondary **Evening Spike (8 PM - 10 PM)**. Monday at 9 PM represents the absolute peak of customer activity.
