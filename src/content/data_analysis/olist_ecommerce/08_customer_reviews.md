## Delivery Delay & Customer Satisfaction Analysis


<font color = "#9dc9cf">23. What is the quantitative correlation between **Delivery Delay** (Actual Delivery Date - Estimated Delivery Date) and the **Average Review Score**? Specifically, at what 'delay threshold' (e.g., +1 day, +3 days) does the average customer rating strictly drop below 3 stars? </font>

**Solution:**

Analytical Methodology for Delivery Delay and Sentiment Correlation

1. **Quantification of Logistical Latency (`order_delay_metrics` CTE)**: The initial phase of the analysis involves calculating the temporal variance between the `order_estimated_delivery_date` and the `order_delivered_customer_date`. By performing an inner join between the `orders` and `order_reviews` datasets, we isolate the `delay_days`—where positive integers signify late deliveries—and associate them directly with the corresponding customer `review_score`.

2. **Aggregation of Sentiment Baselines (`aggregated_scores` CTE)**: To evaluate the impact of fulfillment delays on customer perception, the data is aggregated at the `delay_days` level. This step computes the arithmetic mean of review scores and total transaction volumes for each specific interval, establishing the "On-Time" benchmark required to measure the rate of sentiment degradation.

3. **Identification of the 'Satisfaction Cliff' (Final Query)**: The final logic categorizes results into hierarchical satisfaction tiers via a `CASE` statement. We distinguish between 'Tolerable' delays (where the average score remains $\geq 3.0$) and 'Critical' delays (where scores fall below the $3.0$ threshold). Furthermore, a percentage variance from the "On-Time" benchmark is calculated to quantify the financial and reputational risk associated with extended latencies.

4. **Statistical Significance and Boundary Control**: To maintain the integrity of the findings and prevent outliers from skewing the commercial insights, the output is restricted to intervals with a `volume > 5`. The temporal scope is further constrained to a range of $-10$ to $+30$ days to focus the business intelligence on the most statistically significant and actionable delivery scenarios.

**Insights:**

* **Early Delivery Bonus:** On-time deliveries average a solid 4.03 rating. Beating the estimated delivery date by 1 to 10 days gives a slight "bonus," pushing the average score up to 4.33.
* **The Tolerable Delay:** Customers show a small amount of patience for minor hiccups. Packages arriving 1 or 2 days late take a hit but still manage to maintain an average score above 3 stars (3.73 and 3.18, respectively).
* **The 3-Day Cliff:** The exact threshold where satisfaction falls apart is **3 days late**. At this point, the average rating strictly drops below 3 stars, crashing to 2.68 (a 33.5% drop compared to on-time deliveries).
* **The Point of No Return:** Once a delivery hits 6 days late, the average score plummets below 2.0. From that day onward, ratings mostly flatline near the 1.5 mark. At this stage, the customer experience is completely ruined, regardless of whether the package takes 7 days or 20 days to finally arrive.


## Quality vs. Logistics Matrix Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">24. Can we identify product categories that consistently have **Fast Delivery** (Top 25% speed) but **Low Review Scores** (Bottom 25% rating)? Conversely, which categories have slow delivery but high scores? </font>

**Solution:**


1. The initial phase of the analysis involves the aggregation of delivery lead times and customer satisfaction scores at the category level. By joining the `orders`, `order_items`, `products`, and `order_reviews` datasets, we calculate the arithmetic mean of the `avg_delivery_lead_time` (measuring the duration from purchase to customer delivery) and the `avg_review_score`. A `HAVING` clause is utilized to restrict the results to categories with a `total_orders > 30`, ensuring the statistical integrity of the benchmarks.

2. To establish relative performance tiers, we apply the `percent_rank()` window function to both metrics. The `speed_rank` is calculated in ascending order (where 0.0 represents the fastest 1% of the platform), while the `rating_rank` is also calculated in ascending order (where 0.0 represents the lowest 1% of scores). This normalization allows for a direct comparison across diverse product lines regardless of varying volume.

3. The categorical data is then segmented into a four-quadrant matrix using a conditional `CASE` statement. We specifically isolate 'Product/Catalog Issues'—defined as categories within the top 25% for speed (`speed_rank <= 0.25`) but the bottom 25% for satisfaction (`rating_rank <= 0.25`). Conversely, 'Logistics Bottlenecks' are identified as categories in the bottom 25% for speed (`speed_rank >= 0.75`) that maintain top 25% sentiment scores (`rating_rank >= 0.75`).

4. The resulting classification provides actionable business intelligence for supply chain and catalog management. By identifying the 'Systemic Failure' quadrant (Slow and Hated) versus the 'Gold Standard' (Fast and Loved), stakeholders can prioritize interventions—distinguishing between the need for logistical optimization versus fundamental improvements in product quality or catalog accuracy.

**Insights:**


* **The "Fast but Hated" Problem:** Categories like IT accessories (`informatica_acessorios`) and party supplies (`artigos_de_festas`) arrive faster than average (7 to 9 days) but still get bottom-tier reviews. Since delivery speed isn't the issue, this strongly points to catalog problems—these items are likely of poor quality, arrive broken, or don't match their online descriptions.
* **The "Slow but Loved" Forgiveness:** Customers are surprisingly patient when buying specific, high-value, or specialized goods. Personal computers (`pcs`), musical instruments, and shoes take a long time to deliver (13 to 15 days), yet they maintain high ratings (above 4.2). People are clearly willing to wait as long as the product is exactly what they wanted.
* **The "Systemic Failure" Zone:** Office furniture (`moveis_escritorio`) is the worst performer. It takes almost 21 days to deliver on average and holds a terrible 3.52 rating. Bulky, heavy items are clearly causing huge headaches for our logistics partners, and the slow delivery is destroying customer satisfaction.
* **The "Gold Standard" Champions:** Books (imported, technical, and general) and food (`alimentos`) sit in the perfect quadrant. They are easy to package, ship fast, and have highly predictable quality. As a result, they enjoy the highest ratings on the platform (4.26 to 4.51).
* **Data Quality Warnings:** While looking at the lead times, I noticed some categories like watches (`relogios_presentes`) and industry/business goods have negative lead times (e.g., -154 days or -69 days). This tells me there are data entry errors in the system where the delivery date was somehow recorded *before* the purchase date. This is something I'll need to filter out in my data cleaning process.








## Customer Review Deep-Dive Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">25. What is the distribution of review scores across different product categories? Specifically, which categories have the highest percentage of 1-star reviews, and can we identify any common issues or themes in the negative feedback for these categories? </font>

**Solution:**


1. The analysis commences by establishing a direct linkage between customer reviews and their corresponding product categories (`category_reviews` CTE). By performing inner joins across the `order_reviews`, `order_items`, and `products` datasets, and subsequently applying a left join to the English translation table, we accurately map each review to a standardized category name. A `DISTINCT` clause is strategically implemented to prevent the artificial inflation of review counts in instances where multiple identical items are purchased within a single transaction.

2. Following the data integration, the methodology proceeds to aggregate the review score distributions at the category level (`category_stats` CTE). Utilizing conditional summation logic, the system computes the absolute frequency of each specific star rating—from one to five—alongside the total review volume for the category. A `COALESCE` function is applied to ensure that any products missing categorical metadata are grouped into an 'unknown_category' rather than systematically omitted from the dataset.

3. In the final phase, the absolute frequencies are mathematically converted into proportional metrics to facilitate equitable comparative analysis across diverse product lines. The query calculates the exact percentage of one-star (`pct_one_star`) and five-star reviews. To ensure the analytical findings are statistically robust and not disproportionately skewed by low-volume anomalies, a strict threshold is enforced, restricting the output strictly to categories possessing a minimum of 50 total reviews. The results are ordered descendingly based on the one-star percentage, effectively isolating the product lines responsible for driving the highest proportion of negative customer sentiment on the platform.

**Insights:**

* **Male Fashion is the Most Problematic:** Men's clothing (`fashion_male_clothing`) has the highest 1-star rate on the platform at 23.4%. In e-commerce, high negative feedback in clothing is typically driven by inconsistent sizing or the physical fabric not matching the online pictures.
* **Office Furniture is a Confirmed Failure:** Backing up our delivery speed findings, `office_furniture` performs terribly here as well. It has a nearly 18% 1-star rate and the absolute lowest 5-star rate on the entire list (just 39.6%). Bulky, hard-to-assemble items paired with slow logistics are heavily damaging this category.
* **The "Unknown" Category Risk:** Items tagged as `unknown_category` generate a surprisingly high 1-star rate (16.5% out of 1,470 reviews). If a product is poorly classified, it likely lacks a clear description, which leads to confused buyers and mismatched expectations.
* **Books and Food are the Safest Bets:** Categories like `food_drink`, `books_general_interest`, and `books_technical` boast the lowest 1-star rates (all under 7.5%) and massive 5-star rates (up to 73%). These are standardized, easy-to-ship items that rarely surprise the buyer in a negative way.


## Review Volume vs. Score Polarization Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">26. Is there a correlation between the number of reviews a product receives and its average review score? Specifically, do products with a higher volume of reviews tend to have more polarized ratings (more 1-star and 5-star reviews) compared to products with fewer reviews? </font>

**Insights:**

* **No Correlation with Average Score:** Surprisingly, the number of reviews a product gets does not change its overall rating. Whether a product has 5 reviews or 500, the average score stays incredibly stable between 4.05 and 4.12. 
* **Polarization is a Constant Behavior:** The assumption that highly reviewed products get more polarized (lots of 1s and 5s) is false. Across every single volume bucket, roughly 68% to 70% of all ratings are extreme (either 1-star or 5-star). This tells us that e-commerce customers generally only leave reviews when they either absolutely love or completely hate an item, regardless of the product's popularity.
* **The "Long Tail" Catalog:** The data highlights how massive and fragmented the Olist catalog is. Out of the entire dataset, over 31,000 products fall into the "Low Volume" bucket (1-10 reviews), while only 50 products reached the "Very High" bucket (100+ reviews). This proves that Olist's revenue is driven by a "long tail" of thousands of niche items rather than a few massive blockbusters.


## Seller Performance Analysis


<font color = "#9dc9cf">27. Can we identify specific sellers or products that are responsible for a disproportionate number of 1-star reviews? Specifically, which sellers have the highest percentage of their orders resulting in 1-star reviews, and what common issues are cited in these reviews? </font>

**Solution:**

- To analyze review polarization, customer reviews should first be linked back to the actual products. This must be done in the first CTE by joining the order reviews table with the order items table. A distinct select should be used here because sometimes a customer buys multiple units of the exact same item in one order, but only one review is left for the whole transaction. The distinct keyword will ensure that the single review is not accidentally overcounted for the product.

- Next, the data should be grouped by the product ID to pull baseline metrics for each individual item. The total number of reviews and the overall average score must be calculated. In the same step, a simple case statement will be used to count exactly how many one-star and five-star reviews each product received. This will isolate the extreme ratings needed for the analysis.

- Then, those product-level metrics should be used to assign each product into a specific bucket based on its review volume, such as low, medium, or high. A bucket order column with simple numbers must also be added so the final output will be sorted logically from the lowest volume to the highest, rather than being sorted alphabetically by the bucket name.

- Finally, all the data must be rolled up by those volume buckets in the main query. The share of one-star and five-star reviews should be calculated against the total reviews in each bucket to get the final percentages. The one-star and five-star percentages will then be added together into a polarized percentage metric. This metric will be used to see if highly reviewed products actually trigger more extreme reactions compared to items that only have a handful of reviews.

**Insights:**

* **The 50% Failure Rate:** Seller `1ca7077d...` is the most toxic vendor in this dataset. Out of 114 total orders, 61 resulted in a 1-star review. Failing over 53% of the time is catastrophic for platform trust and drags their average rating down to an abysmal 2.33.
* **High Volume, High Damage:** Seller `2eb70248...` is a major platform risk. They process a solid amount of volume (199 orders) but maintain a 40.2% failure rate, dumping 80 one-star reviews into the marketplace. 
* **The Volume Trap:** Seller `7c67e144...` sits lower on the percentage list with a 19.9% failure rate. However, because they handled 982 orders, they single-handedly created 196 one-star reviews. Even a "moderate" failure rate becomes a massive issue at high volumes.
* **Perfect Sellers Exist:** At the very bottom of the dataset, we can see a group of sellers (like `48efc9d9...` and `18e694e0...`) who processed 30+ orders with exactly zero 1-star reviews. This proves that maintaining a flawless customer experience is completely possible on Olist.
* **Root Causes of 1-Star Reviews:** Connecting this data to our previous geographic and logistics analysis, the most common issues driving these negative reviews are highly predictable. Customers leave 1-star ratings when packages arrive more than 3 days past the estimated delivery window, when sellers take over a week just to dispatch the item, or when products (especially in categories like men's clothing or office furniture) are poor quality and fail to match their online descriptions.




## Customer Review Impact

<font color = "#9dc9cf">28. What is the effect of customer review answers on the average review score? Specifically, do products that receive responses to customer reviews (e.g., seller replies) tend to have higher average review scores compared to products that do not receive any responses? Also the average response time to customer reviews and its correlation with review scores? </font>


**Solution:**

- To analyze the effect of response times on review scores, the gap between when a review was created and when it was answered must first be calculated. This should be done in the first CTE by calculating the difference in hours between the creation date and the answer timestamp from the order reviews table. The data must also be filtered to only include records where a review score actually exists.

- Next, those calculated response times should be segmented into logical buckets to help spot trends. A case statement must be used to categorize each response as fast, medium, slow, or very slow, based on the number of hours it took to reply. A specific category for reviews that never received a response must also be included to serve as a baseline for comparison.

- Finally, the metrics must be aggregated based on these newly created response speed categories in the main query. The total number of reviews, the average response time, and the overall average review score should be calculated for each bucket. The distribution of extreme scores must also be captured by calculating the percentage of one-star and five-star reviews within each category. This final output will be used to determine if faster responses actually correlate with higher overall customer satisfaction and fewer negative ratings.

**Insights:**


* **The "Damage Control" Anomaly:** The most surprising finding is that the fastest responses (under 24 hours) actually correlate with the lowest average score (3.94) and the highest 1-star rate (15.76%). This does not mean fast replies cause bad reviews. Instead, it shows that furious customers trigger immediate "damage control." When a 1-star review drops, sellers rush to reply right away to apologize or fix the issue.
* **The "Happy Batch" Effect:** Reviews that are answered within 1 to 3 days (Medium speed) boast the best average score (4.16) and the lowest 1-star rate (9.5%). It is highly likely that sellers do not feel an urgent need to reply to positive 5-star reviews immediately. Instead, they probably batch-process their "thank you" replies a few days later when they have free time. 
* **Most Sellers are Active:** The vast majority of reviews (over 72,000) are answered within 3 days. This shows that the platform's seller base is generally very active and monitors their customer feedback closely.
* **The Cost of Neglect:** When response times drag on for over a week (averaging 551 hours), the 1-star rate starts to climb back up to over 13%. This suggests that true neglect—where a seller is completely disengaged from their storefront—is linked to a generally poorer customer experience and lower product quality.


## Conclusion


**What We Did:**
* Mapped out the exact correlation between delivery delays and average review scores to find the customer tolerance threshold.
* Categorized products into a matrix of delivery speed versus satisfaction (e.g., "Fast but Hated", "Slow but Loved").
* Analyzed review polarization across different order volumes to understand how customers rate products.
* Isolated the specific toxic sellers driving 1-star reviews and examined how response times correlate with ratings.

**What We Obtained (Key Findings):**
* **The 3-Day Late Cliff:** Customers will forgive a 1-to-2 day delivery delay. However, once a package hits exactly 3 days late, the average rating permanently crashes below 3 stars. At 6 days late, the customer experience is completely unrecoverable (under 2.0 stars).
* **Quality Beats Speed:** Fast shipping cannot save a bad product. Categories like IT accessories and male fashion arrive quickly but get terrible reviews due to likely quality or sizing issues. Conversely, customers happily wait 13+ days for specific high-value items like PCs or musical instruments without punishing the seller's rating.
* **The Polarization Rule:** Customers generally only leave a review if they absolutely love or completely hate an item. Roughly 68% of all ratings across the platform are either 1-star or 5-star, regardless of whether a product is a niche item or a massive bestseller.
* **Toxic Outliers Destroy Trust:** A very small group of high-volume sellers is responsible for a massive chunk of negative feedback. The worst offender we found had an unacceptable 53% failure rate (1-star reviews).
* **The Damage Control Effect:** Sellers reply to negative reviews immediately (under 24 hours) to put out fires and manage angry buyers. Positive 5-star reviews, on the other hand, are usually answered a few days later in batches.
