## Payment Distribution and Risk Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">20. What is the distribution of total revenue across different payment methods (Credit Card, Boleto, Voucher, Debit Card)?  Specifically, does the 'Average Transaction Value' differ significantly between Credit Card users and Boleto users?</font>

**Solution:**

Solution Steps for Payment Method Distribution and ATV

1. **Firstly, we aggregate metrics by payment type (`payment_distribution` CTE)**: We query the `payments` table and group by `payment_type` to calculate the total `transaction_count`, the `total_revenue` (`sum(payment_value)`), and the average transaction value (`avg(payment_value)`).

2. **Secondly, we calculate the platform-wide revenue baseline (`global_metrics` CTE)**: We aggregate the sum of all revenue from the previous CTE to establish the `grand_total_revenue`. This gives us the necessary denominator for calculating market share percentages.

3. **Finally, we compare payment methods and value differences (Final `SELECT`)**: We `CROSS JOIN` the aggregated payment data with the global baseline. By dividing the payment type's revenue by the grand total, we compute the `revenue_share_pct`. Additionally, we format the `avg_transaction_value` (ATV) and use a `CASE` statement to classify the transaction profiles, specifically highlighting the differing use cases of 'Credit Card' (High Convenience / Installment Potential) versus 'Boleto' (Cash-based / Single Payment).

**Insights:**


* **Credit Cards Dominate the Market:** Credit cards are by far the most important payment method for Olist, bringing in an overwhelming 78.3% of the total revenue ($12.5M). 
* **Boleto is Still Essential:** The Brazilian cash-based payment method, Boleto, is the second largest driver, securing almost 18% of the revenue. This shows that a solid portion of our customer base relies on cash or doesn't use traditional credit systems.
* **Credit Drives Bigger Baskets:** There is a clear gap in the Average Transaction Value (ATV). Credit card users spend an average of $163.32, compared to $145.03 for Boleto users. Customers are obviously more willing to make high-ticket purchases when they can take advantage of credit card installments.
* **Vouchers Mean Small Spends:** Vouchers have the lowest ATV at just $65.70. This makes sense, as they are typically used as gift cards, promotional discounts, or partial payments for smaller items rather than for massive purchases. 
* **Debit Cards are Rare:** Surprisingly, standard debit cards are barely used on the platform, accounting for just 1.36% of total revenue. Customers overwhelmingly prefer the installment options of a credit card or the cash accessibility of a Boleto.




## Installment Correlation and High-Ticket Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">21. Is there a positive correlation between the number of installments chosen (`payment_installments`) and  the total order value? Specifically, what percentage of high-ticket orders (\>R\$500) are purchased using 5+ installments?" </font>

**Solution:**

Solution Steps for Payment Method and Installment Analysis

1. **Firstly, we compare payment method performance (Part 1)**: We aggregate the `transaction_count`, `total_revenue`, and `avg_transaction_value` grouped by `payment_type`. By cross-joining this with a global revenue total, we calculate the `revenue_share_pct`, allowing us to compare the financial weight of credit cards versus cash-based methods like Boleto.

2. **Secondly, we correlate installment counts with order value (Part 2 - `installment_stats` CTE)**: We isolate 'credit_card' transactions—since they are the primary source of installments—and group them by the number of `payment_installments`. We calculate the average payment value for each count to see if customers purchasing expensive items tend to choose higher installment numbers.

3. **Thirdly, we isolate the high-ticket segment (Part 2 - `high_ticket_segment` CTE)**: We filter the `payments` table for orders with a value greater than R$500. We then count the total number of these orders and use a conditional sum to identify how many of them utilized 5 or more installments, effectively identifying "financing" behavior.

4. **Finally, we calculate the financing penetration (Part 2 Final `SELECT`)**: We compute the `high_ticket_financing_pct` by dividing our high-installment count by the total high-ticket count. To provide a clear correlation proof, we also use subqueries to fetch and compare the average values of 1-installment versus 10-installment purchases, highlighting the trend toward higher installment counts for more expensive goods.

</div>

**Insights:** 

* **Clear Positive Correlation:** There is a massive link between how many installments a customer chooses and how much they spend. Orders paid in a single payment average just $95.87. However, when customers stretch their payment across 10 installments, the average order value skyrockets to $415.09.
* **Financing is Mandatory for Big Purchases:** For high-ticket items (orders over $500), offering installment plans is absolutely critical. Out of 3,488 high-ticket orders on the platform, a huge 75.6% were purchased using 5 or more installments.
* **Credit Unlocks Revenue:** The data proves that Olist's ability to sell expensive goods is directly tied to its credit card installment options. Without the flexibility to pay over several months, the vast majority of those premium, $500+ sales simply would not happen.


## Regional Payment Preferences & Boleto Penetration

<font color = "#9dc9cf">22. How does payment preference vary by region (`customer_state`)? Are there specific states where "Boleto' usage is isproportionately high compared to the national average, indicating a lower penetration of credit cards? </font>

**Solution:**

Solution Steps for Payment Method, Installment, and Regional Analysis

1. **Firstly, we compare payment method performance (Part 1)**: We aggregate the `transaction_count`, `total_revenue`, and `avg_transaction_value` grouped by `payment_type`. By cross-joining this with a global revenue total, we calculate the `revenue_share_pct`, allowing us to compare the financial weight of credit cards versus cash-based methods like Boleto.

2. **Secondly, we correlate installment counts with order value (Part 2 - `installment_stats` CTE)**: We isolate 'credit_card' transactions—since they are the primary source of installments—and group them by the number of `payment_installments`. We calculate the average payment value for each count to see if customers purchasing expensive items tend to choose higher installment numbers.

3. **Thirdly, we isolate the high-ticket segment (Part 2 - `high_ticket_segment` CTE)**: We filter the `payments` table for orders with a value greater than R$500. We then count the total number of these orders and use a conditional sum to identify how many of them utilized 5 or more installments, effectively identifying "financing" behavior.

4. **Fourthly, we calculate the financing penetration (Part 2 Final `SELECT`)**: We compute the `high_ticket_financing_pct` by dividing our high-installment count by the total high-ticket count. To provide a clear correlation proof, we also use subqueries to fetch and compare the average values of 1-installment versus 10-installment purchases.

5. **Fifthly, we aggregate payment preferences by state (Part 3 - `state_payment_counts` CTE)**: We join the `payments`, `orders`, and `customers` tables to count the volume of each payment type within every `customer_state`. We specifically isolate the counts for 'boleto' and 'credit_card' to prepare for regional penetration analysis.

6. **Finally, we identify regional outliers and Boleto penetration (Part 3 Final `SELECT`)**: We calculate the `state_boleto_pct` for each state and compare it to a `national_avg_boleto_pct` generated via a window function. By calculating the `percentage_point_diff`, we categorize states into profiles like 'High Boleto Usage (Low Credit Penetration)' or 'High Credit Usage (Digital/Banked Hub)' based on their deviation from the national norm.

</div>


**Insights:**

* **The National Baseline:** Across the entire country, the average Boleto usage sits at 20.35%. Most states stay relatively close to this baseline, representing a standard mix of cash and credit.
* **Low Credit Penetration in the North:** States like Amapá (AP), Roraima (RR), and Maranhão (MA) show disproportionately high Boleto usage, ranging from 26% to over 28%. This strongly indicates that customers in these regions have lower access to traditional banking and credit cards, making cash-based payments essential for them to shop online.
* **Highly Banked Regions:** On the other end of the spectrum, Amazonas (AM), Ceará (CE), and Rio Grande do Norte (RN) have the lowest Boleto usage on the platform (13% to 15%). Customers here overwhelmingly prefer to use credit cards. 
* **The Major Economic Hubs:** Our biggest revenue-driving states, São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ), actually fall below the national average for Boleto usage (18.8% and 15.9% respectively). Because these are major economic centers, their populations are highly banked and comfortably rely on credit for e-commerce. 
* **Actionable Takeaway:** If Olist wants to run marketing campaigns in states like AP or MA, advertisements should clearly highlight that Boleto is accepted, as it is a major deciding factor for those specific buyers.


## Conclusion

**What We Did:**
* Calculated the revenue share and Average Transaction Value (ATV) for each payment method (Credit Card, Boleto, Voucher, Debit Card).
* Analyzed the relationship between the number of installments chosen and the success of high-ticket (>$500) sales.
* Mapped out regional payment preferences to find states with high cash (Boleto) dependency versus those with high credit card penetration.

**What We Obtained (Key Findings):**
* **Credit is King:** Credit cards drive the platform, generating over 78% of total revenue. They also encourage customers to spend more, with a higher ATV ($163) compared to Boleto users ($145).
* **Installments Unlock Big Sales:** Offering payment plans is absolutely mandatory for expensive items. Over 75% of all high-ticket orders (above $500) were purchased using 5 or more installments. Without credit, these sales likely wouldn't happen.
* **Boleto is Essential for Accessibility:** While credit dominates, Boleto still secures nearly 18% of revenue. It is especially critical in Northern states like Amapá (AP) and Roraima (RR), where Boleto usage jumps to 28% due to lower local credit card access.
* **Economic Hubs Prefer Credit:** Major markets like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro fall below the national Boleto average, confirming that their highly banked populations comfortably rely on credit for e-commerce.
