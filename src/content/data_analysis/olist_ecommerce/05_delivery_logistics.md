## Delivery Performance Analysis

<font color = "#9dc9cf">11. What is the overall 'On-Time Delivery Rate' (percentage of orders delivered before the `order_estimated_delivery_date`)? Furthermore, what is the average variance between the estimated and actual delivery dates across different states? </font>

**Solution:**

1. **Firstly, we prepare order-level delivery variances (`delivery_data` CTE)**: We join the `orders` and `customers` tables, filtering strictly for successfully 'delivered' orders with valid dates. We use a `CASE` statement to flag if an order was delivered on or before the estimate (`is_on_time`), and use `datediff` to calculate the exact `delivery_variance_days`.

2. **Secondly, we aggregate performance by state (`state_performance` CTE)**: Grouping by `customer_state`, we sum the on-time flags to calculate the `on_time_rate` percentage. We calculate the state's average delivery variance (`state_avg_accuracy`). Crucially, we also use a window function `avg() over ()` without a partition to calculate the `national_avg_accuracy` baseline across all states.

3. **Finally, we classify states against the national benchmark (Final `SELECT`)**: We format the output metrics and use a `CASE` statement to evaluate the state's performance. By comparing the `state_avg_accuracy` against the `national_avg_accuracy` (+/- a 2-day buffer), we categorize the logistics estimation strategy for that region as 'Extremely Conservative', 'Relatively Aggressive', or 'Standard'.

## Freight Cost by Regions

<font color = "#9dc9cf">12. How does the average freight cost (`freight_value`) correlate with average delivery time across different states? Can we identify regions that suffer from the 'Logistics Gap' - paying disproportionately high shipping fees for the slowest service? </font>


**Solution:**


1. **Firstly, we prepare order-level freight and delivery data (`order_metrics` CTE)**: We join the `orders`, `customers`, and `order_items` tables, filtering strictly for successfully 'delivered' orders. We calculate the `total_order_freight` by summing up the freight values of all items within an order (handling multi-item orders properly), and we use `datediff` to calculate the total `delivery_time_days` from purchase to customer delivery.

2. **Secondly, we calculate state averages and national benchmarks (`state_benchmarks` CTE)**: Grouping by `customer_state`, we average both the freight costs (`avg_state_freight`) and delivery times (`avg_state_delivery_time`) to establish the typical performance for each region. Crucially, we use the `avg() over ()` window function to establish the overall `national_avg_freight` and `national_avg_delivery_time` as baselines.

3. **Finally, we classify regional logistics efficiency (Final `SELECT`)**: We format the output metrics and use a `CASE` statement to compare each state's averages against the national benchmarks. By cross-evaluating whether a state is above or below average in both cost and speed, we neatly categorize them into actionable profiles like 'Logistics Gap (High Cost / Slow)', 'Premium Service', 'Budget / Inefficient', or 'Optimized Logistics'.

        c.customer_state,

## Delivery Timeline Decomposition


<font color = "#9dc9cf">13. Can we decompose the total delivery timeline into three distinct stages: 'Approval Time' (Purchase to Approval), 'Dispatch Time' (Approval to Carrier Handover), and 'Last-Mile Delivery' (Carrier to Customer)? Which of these stages contributes the most to overall delays? </font>

**Solution:**

1. **Firstly, we extract time intervals for each fulfillment stage (`order_lifecycle` CTE)**: We use the `datediff` function to calculate the time spent in each distinct phase: 'Approval Time' (purchase to approval), 'Dispatch Time' (approval to carrier handover), and 'Last-Mile Delivery' (carrier to customer). We calculate these differences in seconds and divide by 3600.0 to get precise hour measurements, filtering strictly for 'delivered' orders that have all necessary timestamp data.

2. **Secondly, we calculate the mean duration of each stage (`stage_averages` CTE)**: We aggregate the data by taking the average of the hours spent in each respective stage (`avg_approval_hrs`, `avg_dispatch_hrs`, `avg_last_mile_hrs`, and `avg_total_hrs`). Crucially, we include a `WHERE` clause here to filter out negative durations (`>= 0`), eliminating potential data entry errors or anomalies from skewing our averages.

3. **Finally, we calculate the percentage contributions (Final `SELECT`)**: We convert our aggregated average hour metrics into average days (by dividing by 24.0) for easier human readability. To answer the core of the question—identifying the primary source of delays—we calculate the exact percentage each stage contributes to the total lead time (e.g., `100.0 * avg_last_mile_hrs / avg_total_hrs`).

        -- stage 1: approval time (internal processing)
        approval_hours = datediff(second, order_purchase_timestamp, order_approved_at) / 3600.0,
        
        -- stage 2: dispatch time (warehouse / seller preparation)
        dispatch_hours = datediff(second, order_approved_at, order_delivered_carrier_date) / 3600.0,
        
        -- stage 3: last-mile delivery (carrier performance)
        last_mile_hours = datediff(second, order_delivered_carrier_date, order_delivered_customer_date) / 3600.0,
        
        -- total lead time
        total_lead_time_hours = datediff(second, order_purchase_timestamp, order_delivered_customer_date) / 3600.0
    from 
        orders
    where 
        order_status = 'delivered'
        and order_approved_at is not null
        and order_delivered_carrier_date is not null
        and order_delivered_customer_date is not null

## Local vs Long-Haul Logistics Performance


<font color = "#9dc9cf">14. How does logistics performance compare between 'Local Orders' (where `customer_state` matches `seller_state`) and 'Long-Haul Orders' (Cross-border)? Specifically, what is the 'Speed Premium' - the reduction in delivery days achieved by fulfilling orders locally? </font>

**Solution:**

1. **Firstly, we classify the fulfillment path (`shipment_classification` CTE)**: We join the `orders`, `customers`, `order_items`, and `sellers` tables to access both the customer's and seller's locations. We use a `CASE` statement to flag an order as 'Local' if the `customer_state` matches the `seller_state`, and 'Long-Haul' otherwise. We crucially use `DISTINCT` here to ensure that if a customer buys multiple items from the same seller in one order, we only evaluate the order's delivery timeline once.

2. **Secondly, we calculate individual delivery metrics (`performance_metrics` CTE)**: For each classified order, we calculate the exact `delivery_days` (using seconds divided by 86400.0 for precision) and create a binary flag (`is_on_time`) by comparing the actual delivery date against the estimated delivery date.

3. **Thirdly, we aggregate the performance statistics (`summary_stats` CTE)**: Grouping strictly by our new `shipment_type`, we calculate the total `shipment_count`, the `avg_delivery_days`, and the overall `on_time_rate_pct`. 

4. **Finally, we calculate the 'Speed Premium' (Final `SELECT`)**: We format the output fields and use the `lag()` window function to compare the two rows. By subtracting the current row's average delivery days from the previous row's (ordered descendingly so Long-Haul comes first), we isolate the exact `speed_premium_days`—the amount of time saved by fulfilling an order locally.

## Freight Ratio Analysis by Product Category

<font color = "#9dc9cf">15. What is the average 'Freight Ratio' (Freight Value / Product Price) across different product categories? Can we identify categories where shipping costs are disproportionately high (`>20%` of item value), leading to potential 'Cart Abandonment'?</font>

**Solution:**


1. **Firstly, we aggregate price and freight metrics per category (`category_freight_stats` CTE)**: We join the `order_items` and `products` tables to calculate the total revenue (`sum(price)`) and total freight costs (`sum(freight_value)`) for each `product_category_name`. We also calculate the average price and average freight cost per item, making sure to filter out any records with a null category.

2. **Finally, we calculate the 'Freight Ratio' and classify abandonment risk (Final `SELECT`)**: We compute the `freight_ratio_pct` by dividing the total category freight by the total category revenue (using `nullif` to prevent division by zero). We then use a `CASE` statement to flag categories where shipping costs exceed 20% of the product value as 'High Abandonment Risk (>20%)' and those between 10% and 20% as 'Moderate Overhead'. This allows us to easily spot product lines where shipping fees might be disproportionately high and deterring customers.
